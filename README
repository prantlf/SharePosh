NAME
  SharePosh 1.0 - SharePoint Drive Provider for PowerShell

SYNOPSIS
  PowerShell module to make the SharePoint content accessible in the same way
  as you work with the local file system.

DESCRIPTION
  SharePosh consists of a PowerShell drive provider for SharePoint content
  and a set of cmdlets performing related tasks. The provider supports
  navigation starting on SharePoint web site and following to subsites,
  lists, folders, files or common list items. Reading and writing of file
  version content is supported. Getting values of list item is supported,
  setting values is in development. The provider and the cmdlets use web
  services to communicate with the SharePoint server. Most functionality
  is supported with all SharePoint versions 2007, 2010 and 2013 and with
  both WSS and MOSS (called Foundation and Server in newer product versions).
  Just creating a new web site works only with SharePoint 2013.

REQUIREMENTS
  This module runs on PowerShell 2.0 at least. PowerShell 3.0 is recommended
  because it fixes tab-completion problems. Minimum version of the Microsoft
  .NET Framework is 3.5. If you want to access Office 365 web sites you must
  install the WIF (Windows Identity Framework) runtime; you can download it
  from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17331.

INSTALLATION
  Building the project will produce a folder SharePosh in bin/Debug or
  bin/Release according to your configuration selection. Copy this folder
  either to %USERPROFILE%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\ or to
  %WINDIR%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\ depending on if you want
  to use the module privately or share it with other users on your machine.
  If you copy the folder to other path make sure that it is included in the
  environment variable PSModulePath.

USAGE
  Load the SharePosh module in your PowerShell console by the command
  Import-Module SharePosh. List the available cmdlets by the command
  Get-Command -Module SharePosh. Read the help about the PowerShell drive
  provider for SharePoint by the command Get-Help SharePosh.
